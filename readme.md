Hello, 
The following script in this repo is a script Dan Van Den Bosch wrote several years ago that allows for simple access to databases

You will need to grab from the NUGET packages Microsoft.CSharp

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages".

2. In the NuGet Package Manager, click on the "Browse" tab.

3. In the search box, enter "Microsoft.CSharp" and press Enter to search for the package.

4. Look for the package named "Microsoft.CSharp" in the search results. Ensure that the package is compatible with your project's target framework.

5. Once you find the package, click on it to select it. Then click on the "Install" or "Add" button to add the package to your project.

6. Wait for the package to be downloaded and installed. Once the installation is complete, the reference to Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder should be added to your project.
